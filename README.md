sloppySocket.dxf was drawn with a black background with librecad 2.2.0-alpha, saved as a 2007-dxf format.

It is exact dimensions for 1" hex impact socket, there are no machining tolerances or fit allowances in this drawing.
Likewise, it has sharp corners that should probably not be sharp corners. 

The Intent is to allow square contact between socket and nut faces for optimum pressure distribution \
while also allowing 16 degrees of play from clockwise to counter-clockwise to take advantage of socket momentum when used with an impact driver. 
I retained the red construction layer only so you can see how the geometry was created.

16 degrees is arbitrary and chosen because it retains 75% of full "perfect fit" hexagon contact, and this is the outer 75% which actually does the work. (75% is also arbitrary) In other units a perfect fit haxagon drives with exactly 1/2 of each face, this drives with the outer 3/8ths of each face.
