sloppySocket.dxf was drawn with a black background with librecad 2.2.0-alpha, saved as a 2007-dxf format.

It is exact dimensions for 1" hex impact socket, there are no machining tolerances or fit allowances in this drawing.
Likewise, it has sharp corners that should probably not be sharp corners. 

The Intent is to allow square contact between socket and nut faces for optimum pressure distribution \
while also allowing 16 degrees of play from clockwise to counter-clockwise to take advantage of socket momentum when used with an impact driver. 
I retained the red construction layer only so you can see how the geometry was created.

16 degrees is arbitrary and chosen because it retains 75% of full "perfect fit" hexagon contact, and this is the outer 75% which actually does the work. (75% is also arbitrary) In other units a perfect fit haxagon drives with exactly 1/2 of each face, this drives with the outer 3/8ths of each face.

Addendum: This approach will allow the use of slightly undersized hexagons in the socket, while still being usable on a full sized nut. The inner diameter points will need chamfered to accomodate. Undersizing the socket like this will move the point of contact and center of pressure inboard. The amount that the center of pressure is moved inboard will depend on the undersize of the nut and stiffness of the materials in both socket and nut. The mathmatical lower limit is an outer diameter (corner-corner dimension of the socket) equal to the flat width of the nut, but at this extreme there will be very little remaining driving area on the socket.
